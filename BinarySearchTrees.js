// Binary Search Trees
    // AVL and Red Black Balancing
        //AVL - more space intensive but will maintain a 0(log N) execution
        //Red Black balancing will not be height balanced and may produce an O(n) search execution

// Balanced Vs. Unbalanced 
    // Balanced - maintain balancing to optimize searching
    // Unbalanced - may produce O(n) search

// Binary Heaps
    // No such thing as unbalanced since insertion is left to right
    // Every node at the top level is greater than or less than child levels
        // SLOW LOOKUPS

// Priority Queue
    // Binary Heaps are usaful for priority queues
    // Elements with a higher priority are served before

// Trie
    // Once first node is produced cuts down on possibilities left
